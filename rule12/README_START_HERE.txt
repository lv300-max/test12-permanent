TEST 12 — CORE SYSTEM (APP SIDE)

This package defines EVERYTHING the Test 12 system does.
No web. No marketing. No monetization.

This is meant to be dropped into VS Code and used as the
authoritative instruction set for building the app logic.

Your current app does nothing.
These rules make it do something.

---
WHAT TEST 12 IS:
A controlled testing rotation system.

WHAT IT IS NOT:
- Not installs
- Not reviews
- Not feedback enforcement
- Not file hosting

---
BUILD ORDER (DO THIS IN ORDER):

1. Implement identity + verification gate
2. Implement queue
3. Implement sessions
4. Implement assignment map
5. Implement admin view (read-only first)

Do NOT add features outside these rules.
