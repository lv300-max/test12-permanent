PARTICIPATION RULES

Testing is required for eligibility.

Rules:
- Each session participant must test the 12 other apps in their session.
- A user never tests their own app.
- No tracking of installs or reviews; the system only records “test complete” events.
- Users must pulse/heartbeat to remain eligible.

System must not degrade if:
- Users delay participation (they remain ineligible until they comply)
