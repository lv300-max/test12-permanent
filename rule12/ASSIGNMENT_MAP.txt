ASSIGNMENT MAP (USER VIEW)

Each active user sees:
- Their own app (leftmost)
- 12 other apps assigned (never their own)

Layout rule:
- Exactly 13 icons in one horizontal row
- No scrolling
- No reordering

Assignments:
- Each user’s “12” is the session minus their own app
- Order is consistent per session (other-app order follows session order)
